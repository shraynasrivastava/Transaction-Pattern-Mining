# üìä Methodology Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the machine learning methodologies employed in the Credit Card Fraud Detection System. The approach combines unsupervised anomaly detection with clustering analysis to identify fraudulent transactions and segment users by risk levels.

## üîç Problem Definition

### Business Context
Credit card fraud represents a significant challenge in financial services, with fraudulent transactions causing billions in losses annually. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to adapt to evolving fraud patterns, necessitating machine learning approaches that can identify anomalous behavior patterns.

### Technical Challenges
1. **Extreme Class Imbalance**: Fraudulent transactions represent <0.2% of all transactions
2. **High Dimensionality**: Credit card datasets contain numerous anonymized features
3. **Temporal Patterns**: Fraud patterns evolve over time
4. **Real-time Requirements**: Detection must be fast enough for real-time processing

## üéØ Solution Architecture

### Two-Stage Approach

Our solution employs a two-stage methodology:

1. **Stage 1: Anomaly Detection** - Identify potentially fraudulent individual transactions
2. **Stage 2: Risk Clustering** - Segment users into risk categories based on transaction patterns

This hybrid approach provides both transaction-level and user-level insights.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Algorithms

### 1. Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection

**Algorithm Choice Rationale:**
- **Effectiveness**: Specifically designed for anomaly detection in high-dimensional spaces
- **Efficiency**: Linear time complexity O(n log n)
- **No Assumptions**: Doesn't require assumptions about data distribution
- **Handling Imbalance**: Works well with highly imbalanced datasets

**Technical Implementation:**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Model Configuration
isolation_forest = IsolationForest(
    contamination=0.02,           # Expected fraud rate
    n_estimators=100,             # Number of isolation trees
    max_samples='auto',           # Subsample size
    random_state=42               # Reproducibility
)
```

**Key Parameters:**
- **Contamination (0.02)**: Based on observed fraud rates in financial data
- **N_estimators (100)**: Balanced between accuracy and computational efficiency
- **Max_samples ('auto')**: Automatically optimized based on dataset size

**Algorithm Process:**
1. **Tree Construction**: Build isolation trees by randomly selecting features and split values
2. **Path Length Calculation**: Measure average path length to isolate each point
3. **Anomaly Scoring**: Shorter paths indicate higher anomaly probability
4. **Threshold Application**: Apply contamination threshold to classify anomalies

### 2. K-Means Clustering for Risk Segmentation

**Algorithm Choice Rationale:**
- **Interpretability**: Clear risk segment definitions
- **Scalability**: Efficient for large datasets
- **Optimization**: Elbow method for automatic cluster selection
- **Business Value**: Actionable risk categories for decision-making

**Technical Implementation:**

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Feature Preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
pca = PCA(n_components=0.95)  # Retain 95% variance

# Cluster Optimization
def optimize_clusters(data, min_k=2, max_k=10):
    inertias = []
    for k in range(min_k, max_k + 1):
        kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
        kmeans.fit(data)
        inertias.append(kmeans.inertia_)
    
    # Apply elbow method
    optimal_k = find_elbow_point(inertias)
    return optimal_k
```

**Optimization Process:**
1. **Elbow Method**: Test cluster counts from 2-10
2. **Inertia Calculation**: Measure within-cluster sum of squares
3. **Optimal Selection**: Identify the "elbow" in the inertia curve
4. **Validation**: Cross-validate cluster stability

## üìä Feature Engineering

### 1. Data Preprocessing

**Standardization:**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)
```

**Missing Value Handling:**
- **Detection**: Identify missing or anomalous values
- **Imputation**: Use median values for numerical features
- **Validation**: Ensure data quality post-processing

### 2. Dimensionality Reduction

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=0.95)  # Retain 95% variance
features_pca = pca.fit_transform(features_scaled)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Noise Reduction**: Filter out irrelevant variance
- **Visualization**: Enable 2D/3D cluster visualization
- **Computational Efficiency**: Reduce feature space
- **Multicollinearity**: Address correlated features

### 3. Feature Selection

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Remove highly correlated features (>0.95 correlation)
- Retain features with high variance
- Preserve domain-relevant features

**Variance Thresholding:**
- Remove low-variance features
- Apply threshold of 0.01 for feature retention

## üéØ Risk Scoring Methodology

### Multi-Layer Risk Assessment

Our risk scoring combines multiple signals:

1. **Anomaly Score** (from Isolation Forest)
2. **Cluster Assignment** (from K-Means)
3. **Historical Patterns** (transaction frequency/amounts)

### Risk Level Assignment

```python
def assign_risk_level(anomaly_score, cluster_risk):
    combined_score = (anomaly_score * 0.7) + (cluster_risk * 0.3)
    
    if combined_score < 0.3:
        return "Low Risk"
    elif combined_score < 0.7:
        return "Medium Risk"
    else:
        return "High Risk"
```

**Thresholds:**
- **Low Risk (<0.3)**: Normal transaction patterns
- **Medium Risk (0.3-0.7)**: Moderately suspicious patterns
- **High Risk (>0.7)**: Highly suspicious patterns requiring investigation

## üîß Model Validation
